# Finding 2nd Largest Value in Binary Search Tree (BST)

Given a binary search tree (not balanced), print the second largest value.

Bonus:  Provide a flexible implementation that can get (for example) the third largest value.

## Running

Run one of the program file using Ruby!

My first implementation is in the file `sec_largest_bst.rb`

Created a more generic approach in the file `largest_smallerthan_x.rb`

## Output

### sec_largest_bst.rb

```
Tree 1 - Largest is 12
Tree 1 - Second largest is 11

Tree 2 - Largest is 10
Tree 2 - Second largest is 9
```

### largest_smallerthan_x.rb

```
Tree 1 - Largest is 12
Tree 1 - Second Largest is 11
Tree 1 - Third Largest is 10

Tree 2 - Largest is 10
Tree 2 - Second Largest is 9
Tree 2 - Third Largest is 8
```
